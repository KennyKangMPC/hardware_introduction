    "# What scientists must know about hardware to write fast code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Find this notebook at https://github.com/jakobnissen/hardware_introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is used in many fields of science today, where individual scientists often have to write custom code for their own projects. For most scientists, however, computer science is not their field of expertise; They have learned programming by necessity. I count myself as one of them. While we may be reasonably familiar with the *software* side of programming, we rarely have even a basic understanding of how computer *hardware* impacts code performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this tutorial is to give non-professional programmers a *brief* overview of the features of modern hardware that you must understand in order to write fast code. It will be a distillation of what have learned the last few years. This tutorial will use Julia because it allows these relatively low-level considerations to be demonstrated easily in a high-level, interactive language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### This is not a guide to the Julia programming language\n",
    "To write fast code, you must first understand your programming language and its idiosyncrasies. But this is *not* a guide to the Julia programming language. I recommend reading the [performance tips section](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/) of the Julia documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### This is not an explanation of specific datastructures or algorithms\n",
    "Besides knowing your language, you must also know your own code to make it fast. You must understand the idea behind big-O notation, why some algorithms are faster than others, and how different data structures work internally. Without knowing *what an `Array` is*, how could you possibly optimize code making use of arrays?\n",
    "\n",
    "This too, is outside the scope of this paper. However, I would say that as a minimum, a programmer should have an understanding of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How a binary integer is represented in memory\n",
    "* How a floating point number is represented in memory (learning this is also necessary to understand computational inacurracies from floating point operations, which is a must when doing scientific programming)\n",
    "* The memory layout of a `String` including ASCII and UTF-8 encoding\n",
    "* The basics of how an `Array` is structured, and what the difference between a dense array of e.g. integers and an array of references to objects are\n",
    "* The principles behind how a `Dict` (i.e. hash table) and a `Set` works\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, I would also recommend familiarizing yourself with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Heaps\n",
    "* Deques\n",
    "* Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "### This is not a tutorial on benchmarking your code\n",
    "To write fast code *in practice*, it is necessary to profile your code to find bottlenecks where your machine spends the majority of the time. One must benchmark different functions and approaches to find the fastest in practice. Julia (and other languages) have tools for exactly this purpose, but I will not cover them here."

A typical consumer laptop has around $10^{11}$ bits of RAM memory.\n",

    "\n",
    "When working with data too large to fit into RAM, load in the data chunk by chunk, e.g. one line at a time, and operate on that.

If not, read another large chunk into your buffer from the file. This approach minimizes disk reads.

    "The RAM is faster than the disk, and the CPU in turn is faster than RAM. A CPU ticks like a clock, with a speed of about 3 GHz, i.e. 3 billion ticks per second. One \"tick\" of this clock is called a *clock cycle*. While this is not really true, you may imagine that every cycle, the CPU executes a single, simple command called a *CPU instruction* which does one operation on a small piece of data. The clock speed then can serve as a reference for other timings in a computer. It is worth realizing that in a single clock cycle, a photon will travel only around 10 cm, and this puts a barrier to how fast memory (which is placed some distance away from the CPU) can operate. In fact, modern computers are so fast that a significant bottleneck in their speed is the delay caused by the time needed for electricity to move through the wires inside the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "On this scale, reading from RAM takes around 100 clock cycles. Similarly to how the slowness of disks can be mitigated by copying data to the faster RAM, data from RAM is copied to a smaller memory chip physically on the CPU, called a *cache*. The cache is faster because it is physically on the CPU chip (reducing wire delays), and because it uses a faster type of RAM, static RAM, instead of the slower (but cheaper to manufacture) dynamic RAM. Because it must be placed on the CPU, limiting its size, and because it is more expensive to produce, a typical CPU cache only contains around $10^8$ bits, around 1000 times less than RAM. There are actually multiple layers of CPU cache, but here we simplify it and just refer to \"the cache\" as one single thing:\n",

    "When the CPU requests a piece of data from the RAM, say a single byte, it will first check if the memory is already in cache. If so, it will read from it from there. This is much faster, usually just a few clock cycles, than access to RAM. If not, we have a *cache miss*, and your program will stall for tens of nanoseconds while your computer copies data from RAM into the cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not possible, except in very low-level languages, to manually manage the CPU cache. Instead, you must make sure to use your cache effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective use of the cache comes down to *locality*, temporal and spacial locality:\n",
    "* By *temporal locality*, I mean that data you recently accessed likely resides in cache already. Therefore, if you must access a piece of memory multiple times, make sure you do it close together in time.\n",
    "* By *spacial locality*, I mean that you should access data from memory addresses close to each other. Your CPU does not copy *just* the requested bytes to cache. Instead, your CPU will always copy larger chunk of data (usually 512 consecutive bits).\n",
    "\n",
    "From this information, one can deduce a number of simple tricks to improve performance:\n",
    "* Use as little memory as possible. When your data takes up less memory, it is more likely that your data will be in cache. Remember, a CPU can do approximately 100 small operations in the time wasted by a single cache miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When reading data from RAM, read it sequentially, such that you mostly have the next data you will be using in cache, instead of in a random order. In fact, modern CPUs will detect if you are reading in data sequentially, and *prefetch* upcoming data, that is, fetching the next chunk while the current chunk is being processed, reducing delays caused by cache misses.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this, let's compare the time spent on the `random_access` function above with a new function `linear_access`. This function performans the same computation as `random_access`, but uses `i` instead of `n` to  access the array, so it access the data in a linear fashion. Hence, the only difference is the memory access pattern.\n",

Your entire main memory is segmented into cache lines. For example, memory addresses 0 to 63 is one cache line, addresses 64 to 127 is the next, 128 to 191 the next, et cetera. Your CPU may only request one of these cache lines from memory, and not e.g. the 64 bytes from address 30 to 93.\n",

    "Inside RAM, data is kept on either the *stack* or the *heap*. The stack is a simple data structure with a beginning and end, similar to a `Vector` in Julia. The stack can only be modified by adding or subtracting elements from the end, analogous to a `Vector` with only the two mutating operations `push!` and `pop!`. These operations on the stack are very fast. When we talk about \"allocations\", however, we talk about data on the heap. Unlike the stack, the heap has an unlimited size (well, it has the size of your computer's RAM), and can be modified arbitrarily, deleting any objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, it may seem obvious that all objects need to be placed in RAM, must be able to be retrieved and deleted at any time by the program, and therefore need to be allocated on the heap. And for some languages, like Python, this is true. However, this is not true in Julia and other efficient, compiled languages. Integers, for example, can often be placed on the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do some objects need to be heap allocated, while others can be stack allocated? To be stack-allocated, the compiler needs to know for certain that:\n",

    "* The object is a reasonably small size, so it fits on the stack. This is needed for technical reasons for the stack to operate.\n",
    "* The compiler can predict exactly *when* it needs to add and destroy the object so it can destroy it by simply popping the stack (similar to calling `pop!` on a `Vector`). This is usually the case for local variables in compiled languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia has even more constrains on stack-allocated objects.\n",
    "* The object should have a fixed size known at compile time.\n",
    "* The compiler must know that object never changes. The CPU is free to copy stack-allocated objects, and for immutable objects, there is no way to distinguish a copy from the original. This bears repeating: *With immutable objects, there is no way to distinguish a copy from the original*. This gives the compiler and the CPU certain freedoms when operating on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Julia, we have a concept of a *bitstype*, which is an object that recursively contain no heap-allocated objects. Heap allocated objects are objects of types `String`, `Array`, `Symbol`, mutable objects, or objects containing any of the previous. Bitstypes are more performant exactly because they are immutable, fixed in size and can almost always be stack allocated. The latter point is also why objects are immutable by default in Julia, and leads to one other performance tip: Use immutable objects whereever possible.\n",

If the object is returned for later use (and not immediately returned to another, fully compiled function), we say that the object *escapes*, and must be allocated.\n",
    "* Your object's type must be a bitstype.\n",

Thus, alignment is a much more serious issue when using SIMD. Since array beginnings are always aligned, this is usually not an issue, but in cases where you are not guaranteed to start from an aligned starting point, such as with matrix operations, this may make a significant difference. In brand new CPUs with 512-bit registers, the issues is even worse as the SIMD size is the same as the cache line size, so *all* loads would be misaligned if the initial load is.\n",

After all, if the code is supposed to raise a bounds error after 3 iterations, even a single SIMD operation would be wrong! To achieve SIMD vectorization then, all boundschecks must be disabled.

After queueing a branch, the CPU immediately queues instructions from whatever branch predicted by the branch predictor. The correctness of the guess is verified later, when the queued branch is being executed. If the guess was correct, great, the CPU saved time by guessing. If not, the CPU has to empty the pipeline and discard all computations since the initial guess, and then start over. This process causes a delay of a few nanoseconds.\n",

Actually, for the most optimized programs, it usually leads to better performance to *disable* hyperthreading. Most workloads are not that optimized and can really benefit from hyperthreading, so we'll stick with 16 threads for now.\n",

    "A prerequisite for efficient use of multithreading is that your computation is able to be broken up into multiple chunks that can be worked on independently. Luckily the majority of compute-heavy tasks (at least in my field of work, bioinformatics), contain sub-problems that are *embarassingly parallel*. This means that there is a natural and easy way to break it into sub-problems that can be processed independently. For example, if a certain __independent__ computation is required for 100 genes, it is natural to use one thread for each gene.\n",

Julia sets are named after Gaston Julia, and have nothing to do with the Julia language. Julia sets are (often) fractal sets of complex numbers. By mapping the real and complex component of the set's members to the X and Y pixel value of a screen, one can generate the LSD-trippy images associated with fractals.\n",

We then record the number of times $f$ can be applied to any given complex number $z$ before $|z| > 2$. The number of iterations correspond to the brightness of one pixel in the image. We simply repeat this for a range of real and imaginary values in a grid to create an image.\n",

    "\n",
    "Despite the potential for great gains, in my opinion, multithreading should be one of the last resorts for performance improvements, for three reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implementing multithreading is harder than other optimization methods in many cases. In the example shown, it was very easy. In a complicated workflow, it can get messy quickly.\n",
    "2. Multithreading can cause hard-to-diagnose and erratic bugs. These are almost always related to multiple threads reading from, and writing to the same memory. For example, if two threads both increment an integer with value `N` at the same time, the two threads will both read `N` from memory and write `N+1` back to memory, where the correct result of two increments should be `N+2`! Infuriatingly, these bugs appear and disappear unpredictably, since they are causing by unlucky timing. These bugs of course have solutions, but it is tricky subject outside the scope of this document.\n",
    "3. Finally, achieving performance by using multiple threads is really achieving performance by consuming more resources, instead of gaining something from nothing. Often, you pay for using more threads, either literally when buying cloud compute time, or when paying the bill of increased electricity consumption from multiple CPU cores, or metaphorically by laying claim to more of your users' CPU resources they could use somewhere else. In contrast, more *efficent* computation costs nothing."

    "\n",
    "As shown in the above example with the Julia set, the task of creating computer images are often embarassingly parallel with an extremely high degree of parallelizability. In the limit, the value of each pixel is an independent task. This calls for a chip with a high number of cores to do effectively. Because generating graphics is a fundamental part of what computers do, nearly all commercial computers contain a GPU. Often, it's a smaller chip integrated into the motherboard (*integrated graphics*, popular in small laptops). Other times, it's a large, bulky card.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPUs have sacrificed many of the bells and whistles of CPUs covered in this document such as specialized instructions, SIMD and branch prediction. They also usually run at lower frequencies than CPUs. This means that their raw compute power is many times slower than a CPU. To make up for this, they have a high number of cores. For example, the high-end gaming GPU NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti has 4,352 cores. Hence, some tasks can experience 10s or even 100s of times speedup using a GPU. Most notably for scientific applications, matrix and vector operations are highly parallelizable.\n",

At the time of writing, these chips are uncommon, expensive, poorly supported and have limited uses, and are therefore not of any interest for non-computer science researchers."
